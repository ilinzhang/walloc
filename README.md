# walloc
Like malloc, but made by Will, so walloc

No but for real, it's just malloc. I like systems programming and I got bored.

Walloc includes (or will include, pun intended):
- walloc(size_t size): traditional malloc
- free(void* ptr): frees a memory location
- calloc, and realloc: just like the 'real' ones
